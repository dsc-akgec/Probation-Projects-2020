# Object Detection using YOLOv3

### Project Description
The project utilizes OpenCV library to apply YOLOv3 algorithm for object detection in images, videos and real time. The code is compatible to run on a CPU. I used the pre-trained weights for COCO dataset which is capable of recognizing 80 objects.

### Link to download pre-trained weights for COCO dataset
Create a folder using titled "weights" and add these files. For better speed in videos and real time, one can use the tiny weights file instead of the original one. However, the detection becomes a little less efficient in this case. So, try using the original weights file for more accuracy.
